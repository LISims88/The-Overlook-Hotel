## Context:

The basis of this project was to build a web application that allows users to login, view upcoming and past bookings, see how much it costs and book by day and room type. Based on the users experience the user can book a room and see how much it will cost them for the room per night. The website's functionality is very basic and has room for more complex features to be added in the future. This project took abott 30 hours to complete in the span of a week

## Learning Goals:

The learning goals of this project was for me as learning Developers to utilize testing in the building and planning of the web application while integrating the use of APIs with GET and POST request. This project was also a chance to further cement the use of iterators. This project was to solidify our understanding of integrating SCSS, Javascript, and HTML, and how to simultaneously manage input on the DOM and data model. The technology we use in this learning experience was Mocha, Chai, and Webpack.
